When I was 15 years old, my family moved from Salt Lake City, Utah to Geneva, Switzerland. I learned French, played European Football (soccer), hiked in the Alps and ate lots of fresh bread and Swiss chocolate. This experience changed my perspective and in many ways changed my life. I spent five years in Europe â three in Switzerland and two in Spain, picking up Spanish along the way. I loved traveling across Europe, learning about the different people and cultures â everywhere from France to Romania to the Netherlands. Since then, I have traveled and worked in countries such as Brazil, China, El Salvador, Canada, South Africa and Mexico. I love experiencing new people and new places. These experiences led me to get an MBA at the Thunderbird School of Global Management. Prior to my MBA, I worked for KPMG and Opportunity Fund in the Silicon Valley. After Thunderbird, I started my own business, connecting companies that needed help to professors and students around the US who could carry out projects for them, as a way for students to get real-world experience. I love the idea of learning by doing. In my opinion, there is no better way to learn. My passion for experiential learning led me to the University of Illinois, where I have spent the last 5 years. Until recently, I was the Director of Illinois Business Consulting, the largest university consulting organization in the US. I am now the Director of Action Learning for the College of Business at the University of Illinois. During this time, I have worked with approximately 1,500 students on more than 200 consulting projects with businesses and nonprofits around the world.

Bloomfield is Professor of Physics at the University of Virginia, where he has been teaching since 1985. Bloomfield grew up taking everything apart and, with the notable exception of one recalcitrant mechanical clock, he managed to get them all back together again (or at least that\'s what he remembers). He also survived numerous electrical shocks and chemical accidents in his youth, not all of which were unexpected. When he arrived at Amherst College, tinkering with things wasn\'t offered as a major, so he chose the closest available option: he majored in physics. Bloomfield received his B.A. in 1979 summa cum laude and his Ph.D. in physics from Stanford University in 1983. He was a postdoctoral fellow at AT&T Bell Laboratories until 1985, when he joined the faculty of the University of Virginia as an Assistant Professor of Physics. He has been there ever since. Bloomfield is the recipient of numerous awards for his research in atomic, condensed matter, and optical physics, including the Apker Award of the American Physical Society, a Presidential Young Investigator Award of the National Science Foundation, a Young Investigator Award of the Office of Naval Research, and an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and he is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. \n\nIn 1991, Bloomfield decided to try teaching physics the way he originally learned physics: in the context of everyday things. He created a course called How Things Work and taught it to 92 students at the University of Virginia its first semester. He was hooked and evidently so were the students, because 261 of them took the course its second semester. Since then, Bloomfield has taught physics to nearly ten thousand non-science students at the University and received both a 1998 State of Virginia Outstanding Faculty Award and the 2001 Pegram Medal of the Southeastern Section of the American Physical Society for that teaching. His course became an innovative introductory textbook entitled How Things Work: The Physics of Everyday Life, 5th Edition (Wiley, 2013) and that textbook became a more comprehensive trade book entitled How Everything Works: Making Physics Out of the Ordinary (Wiley, 2008). In addition to his books, Bloomfield is the author of more than 100 publications in the fields of atomic clusters, autoionizing states, high-resolution laser spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, computer science, and general science literacy. \n\nBloomfield works extensively with professional societies and the media to explain physics to the general public and has appeared frequently on television and radio. He co-hosted the television series Some Assembly Required on the Discovery Channel (2007-2008) and appeared frequently in Known Universe on the National Geographic Channel (2009). He is appearing in his 5th season of \"Forces of Hockey\" (2010-2014) for the Washington Capitals \"Caps Red Line\" program and has won 3 regional Emmy awards. Although he enjoys the challenge of explaining physics on the small screen, he is well aware that he is not an actor and that he merely plays one on television. \n\nBloomfield\'s years of experimenting with everything he can get his hands on, and reading about those he can\'t, have made him something rare in modern day science: a generalist. More specifically, he knows enough to be dangerous in a broad swath of the physical sciences and even some of the life sciences. That background has allowed him to serve frequently as a science consultant and as an expert witness in matters that require a broad understanding of physics and scientific issues. Although Bloomfield struggles to keep his research, teaching, and service activities from consuming every available second, he has too much fun with all of them to stop.','Professor of Physics',274),(425,'https://goo.gl/PRXd19','Pedro GÃ³mez es licenciado en MatemÃ¡ticas e Ingeniero Industrial de la Universidad de los Andes, en BogotÃ¡, Colombia; obtuvo un Master of Arts en EconomÃ­a en The University of Kent at Canterbury, Inglaterra, un Master of Science en LÃ³gica y MÃ©todo CientÃ­fico en The London School of Economics, Londres y un Diplome dâEtudes Approfondies en SociologÃ­a en la Universidad ParÃ­s III, ParÃ­s.

She researches across two distinct areas. In her teaching she investigates theories of mapping, and new developments in creative thinking processes as applied to drawing, design and other disciplines. In her practice she explores the relationships between words, objects and memory in mixed media drawings and bookworks. Artworks by Emma are held in seven public collections in four countries, including the Hospital Trust for Scotland who purchased two artworks commissioned by the Scottish Arts Council for the exhibition Wordworks. Emma has held a number of senior administrative roles including Program Director of the Bachelor of Design degree for five years, three terms as Presiding Member of Faculty, and Deputy President of the UNSW Academic Board. In addition to teaching creative thinking to undergraduate and postgraduate students in nine Faculties at UNSW, Emma also teaches content relating to the influence of scientific illustration techniques on design processes, including those used in the film industry. In researching this she has visited Skywalker Ranch, Pixar and Animal Logic (at Fox Film Studios). Emma won the Dean\'s Award for Innovative Teaching for her two creative thinking online courses, and has been involved in Executive Education with Thiess, the Natural History Museum, London, The Agile Leader course at UTS and others. Emma researched and worked with Arup 2010-2013 to integrate creative thinking processes into their Staff Development initiatives and internal Design School, including a Moodle Course offered to their 10,000+ employees around the world. She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, London and Visiting Fellow at the Centre for Drawing, Wimbledon College of Art. In 2011 she was Guest Editor of the TRACEY Journal on Drawing Knowledge, Loughborough University, and in 2012 was Chair of the Drawing Knowledge Conference where she was one of four Keynote speakers. In 2013 and 2014 she has taught Tools for Creative Thinking to postgraduate students in the Design for Social Innovation course at the Centre for Social Impact, and given guest lectures to PhD students in Engineering and at the INSPIRE NSW symposium. In the 2014 October issue of The Blue Notebook: Journal for Artists\' Books, University of the West of England, (Vol 9 No 1) Emma published an article on A Place Where Things Meet: Creative and Conceptual Blending. In 2006 she was awarded one of the seven prizes in the International Biennial of Drawing, Europe. The three selected drawings were subsequently chosen for the touring Best of the International Drawing Biennial exhibition, which was exhibited at the International Currents Gallery, Chicago, USA in 2007 and in four other European locations. Emma was subsequently selected for the 2008, 2010 and 2012 International Biennials of Drawing. Her work has also been selected for the Adelaide Perry Prize for Drawing and the Jacaranda Acquisitive Drawing Prize in Australia. Since 2005, Emma has exhibited in 7 countries (Norway, Italy, France, USA, Germany, Czech Republic and Australia). Emma was selected as the Artist in Residence at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, which continued her drawing series exploring endangered plant species. This culminated in a solo exhibition at the Red Box Gallery in the Domain, Sydney which was held in February-March 2009, where 27 mixed media drawings were displayed. The exhibition, called Ascendant and Descendant explored the impact of climate change on rare and endangered Australian flora, and reflected the research work undertaken by scientists at the RBG.','Associate Professor',428),(493,'NULL','NULL','Lecturer',369),(494,'NULL','Jeffrey Tzu Kwan Valino Koh has spent most of his life so far in Toronto, Canada but has managed to live, work and study in Sydney, Zurich, London, Rotterdam, Berlin, Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo.
